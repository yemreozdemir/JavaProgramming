  /*
        noun: Fibonacci sequence
a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
 Write a program to print
		 Fibonacci series of n terms
		 where n is declared by user :
		 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,......
		This is a example of Fibonacci series of 6 terms
		term number		0	1	2	3	4	5	6  7
		Actual value	0, 	1, 	1, 	2, 	3, 	5, 	8  13
